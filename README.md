# TRI_MultiVehicle_Sim
This repo provides the python implementation of simulation of muti-vehicle traffic patterns in Carla Simulator. The traffic patterns are generated through the DPGP algorithm using Gaussian Process to represent multi-vehicle driving scenarios with Dirichlet Process adapting cluster numbers. The driving algorithm has been implemented to provide accurate trajectory tracking and incorporation of traffic rules for realisitc simulation of the traffic patterns. 
The python version code for the DPGP algorithm implemented by Vinay Varma Kalidindi, Mengdi Xu @SafeAI lab, Carnegie Mellon University.
The driving algorithm, vehicle controller and Carla client codes have been implemented by Ashish Roongta @SafeAI lab, Carnegie Mellon University.
